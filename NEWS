* Changes in c_chan 1.2

+ Eliminated `CHAN_NONE`: `chan_select()` now returns `EAGAIN` when no channel
  was selected due to none being ready and duration being `CHAN_NO_WAIT`. This
  is consistent with `chan_recv()` and `chan_send()`.


* Changes in c_chan 1.1.1

+ Now always correctly returning an error value from `chan_select()`.


* Changes in c_chan 1.1

+ Added `CHAN_NO_WAIT` as a synonym for `NULL`.

+ Added `chan_cap()` and `chan_len()` functions.

+ Functions that return an error value (positive) now also set `errno` to it.

+ `chan_select()` now returns the actual error code upon error rather than just
  -1.  (It still also sets `errno`.)


* Changes in c_chan 1.0.3

+ Extracted linked list from observers so select can be in more than one list.

+ Now handling spurious wake-ups.


* Changes in c_chan 1.0.2

+ Now using `rand_r` rather than `rand`.


* Changes in c_chan 1.0.1

+ Selecting from a closed, but non-empty, buffered channel now works.


* Changes in c_chan 1.0

+ Initial version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in c_chan 1.1

+ Functions that return an error value (positive) now also set `errno` to it.

+ `chan_select()` now returns the actual error code upon error rather than just
  -1.  (It still also sets `errno`.)


* Changes in c_chan 1.0.3

+ Extracted linked list from observers so select can be in more than one list.

+ Now handling spurious wake-ups.


* Changes in c_chan 1.0.2

+ Now using `rand_r` rather than `rand`.


* Changes in c_chan 1.0.1

+ Selecting from a closed, but non-empty, buffered channel now works.


* Changes in c_chan 1.0

+ Initial version.
